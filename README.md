# Physics-masters

This project is meant to explore the possibility of training and RNN to classify trajectories generated by the Standard map dynamical system.

- requirements:
    - python==3.10
    - pytorch lightning
    - pyyaml
    - tensorboard
    - pandas
    - matplotlib

- activate conda environment with
source ~/.bashrc
conda activate rnn_env

- install packages in venv environment with
conda install package_name

- main functionalities:
  - to sample parameters from grid: python gridsearch.py
  - to run a single training session: python trainer.py
  - to run a single parameter update: python update.py
  - to run hyperparameter optimizaton: bash main_c.slurm
